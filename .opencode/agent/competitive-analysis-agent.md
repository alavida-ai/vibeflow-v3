## Expected Output Format

### Comprehensive Analysis Report
```markdown
## Competitive Landscape Analysis

### Top Performing Content
1. **Article 1**: [URL] - 2,500 words, strong technical depth, weak on implementation
2. **Article 2**: [URL] - 1,800 words, great examples, outdated statistics
3. **Article 3**: [URL] - 3,200 words, comprehensive but generic approach

### Content Gap Analysis
- **Missing Implementation Guides**: Competitors focus on theory, lack practical steps
- **Outdated Examples**: Most use 2-3 year old case studies
- **Surface-Level Coverage**: Limited depth on advanced techniques

### Differentiation Opportunities
1. **Current Data**: Use 2024 statistics and trends
2. **Practical Focus**: Step-by-step implementation guides
3. **Industry-Specific Examples**: Tailored case studies for target audience
4. **Interactive Elements**: Tools, calculators, or templates

### Content Strategy Recommendations
- Target 2,800-3,500 words for comprehensive coverage
- Include 3-5 recent case studies (2023-2024)
- Structure with actionable subheadings
- Incorporate interactive elements for engagement
