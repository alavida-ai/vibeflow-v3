# SEO Blog Generation: Agentic Workflow System

A sophisticated AI-powered content creation system that uses specialized agents to research, analyze, and produce high-quality SEO-optimized blog posts with images. Built with [Mastra](https://mastra.ai) framework, this project demonstrates the power of agentic workflows where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex tasks.

## üöÄ Overview

This system implements an **agentic workflow** - a collaborative AI architecture where specialized agents work together, each handling specific aspects of the content creation process. The workflow transforms a simple topic input into a complete, SEO-optimized blog post with relevant images.

### What is an Agentic Workflow?

An agentic workflow is an AI system design where multiple specialized agents collaborate to complete complex tasks. Each agent has:
- **Specialized expertise** in their domain
- **Specific tools** tailored to their responsibilities  
- **Clear objectives** within the larger workflow
- **Autonomy** to make decisions within their scope

This approach provides better quality, reliability, and maintainability compared to monolithic AI systems.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of **5 specialized agents** orchestrated through **2 main workflows**:
